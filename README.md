# Block_2_Project
Password Strength Checker
This program will take in a string from the user of a length of no longer than 6 without any spaces. The program will then take the string and add points if it includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It will then remove points for repeating characters. It prints out a final score at the end. The score is out of 8.
To run the program, copy the text in the text file and paste it into any IDE of your choice, or even a web IDE like JDoodle. Then, run the program and everything will work from there.
**WARNING:** This tool was built for educational purposes, and may not be the best tool to use to grade your passwords. It does not take into account the exact sequence of letters or any likeness your password has to any word. Do not rely on this tool to provide a perfect score for your password.
This tool can be used to grade short passwords, but should not be relied upon for confidence in all passwords. The responsibility is on you, the user, to think through your own password to determine whether or not it is as secure as you think it is.
